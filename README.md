# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## What was asked?
It was asked that I create a portfolio showing some of my work.

Acceptable criteria included 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## What refrences did I use?
In addition to going back into the lecture videos, I used the following outside sources to help build this portfolio.

## How could this be improved?

This code could be added to by styling it more advanced. As the class continues, I will learn how add more skill to this.
